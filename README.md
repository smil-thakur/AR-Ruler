Measure through your camera


<h1>Distance Measurement AR App<h1>
This iOS app, developed using Swift, leverages the power of augmented reality (AR) technology to measure distances between two or more points in real life. By using the device's camera and ARKit framework, the app overlays virtual objects onto the real world, allowing users to accurately measure distances without the need for physical measuring tools.

<h6>Features<h6>
<ul>
<li>Measure distance between two points: Users can select two points in the real world by tapping on the screen, and the app will calculate the distance between them in real-time.</li>
<li>Measure distance between multiple points: The app also supports measuring distances between multiple points. Users can add additional points by tapping on the screen, and the app will continuously update the total distance based on the selected points.
</li>
<li>Visualize measurements in AR: The measured distances are displayed as virtual lines in augmented reality, making it easy for users to visualize and understand the measurements in relation to the real-world objects.
</li>
<li>Accurate and precise measurements: The app utilizes the ARKit framework's advanced tracking capabilities to ensure accurate and precise distance measurements.</li>
</ul>
